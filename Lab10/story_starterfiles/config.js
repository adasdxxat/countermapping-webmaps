Managed by the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA), they comprise the largest housing development in Brooklyn. The city classifies Red Hook Houses as being in flood zone 1, indicating high flood risk. During Hurricane Sandy in 2012, the development was inundated with 6 feet (1.8 m) of flood water through sewer overflow and high tides.',
